                <h3>1. The terms and conditions</h3>
                <p>
                    The following are the Terms and Conditions (the "Agreement")

                    via multiple websites or applications whether owned and/or

                    >. By accessing or using the Platform, you are entering into
                    this Agreement. You should read this Agreement carefully
                    before starting to use the Platform. If you do not agree to
                    be bound to any term of this Agreement, you must not access
                    the Platform. When the terms "we", "us", "our" or similar
                    are used in this Agreement, they refer to the owners of the
                    Platform.
                </p>

                <h3>2. Privacy and security</h3>

                    found on our Privacy Policy available at
                    <a href="privacy.html">privacy-policy</a>
                    (the "Privacy Policy"). By agreeing to this Agreement and/or
                    by using the Platform, you are also agreeing to the terms of
                    the Privacy Policy. The Privacy Policy is incorporated into
                    and deemed a part of this Agreement. The same rules that
                    apply regarding changes and revisions of this Agreement also
                    apply to changes and revisions of the Privacy Policy.

                    claim. This section (limitation of liability) shall survive
                    the termination or expiration of this Agreement.

                <h3>6. Modifications and interruptions</h3>
                <p>
                    You understand, agree and acknowledge that we may modify,
                    suspend, disrupt or discontinue the Platform, any part of
                    the Platform or the use of the Platform, whether to all
                    clients or to you specifically, at any time with or without
                    notice to you. You agree and acknowledge that we will not be
                    liable for any of the aforementioned actions or for any
                    losses or damages that are caused by any of the
                    aforementioned actions. The Platform depends on various
                    factors such as software, hardware and tools, either our own
                    or those owned and/or operated by our contractors and
                    suppliers. While we make commercially reasonable efforts to
                    ensure the Platform’s reliability and accessibility, you
                    understand and agree that no platform can be 100% reliable
                    and accessible and so we cannot guarantee that access to the
                    Platform will be uninterrupted or that it will be
                    accessible, consistent, timely or error-free at all times.
                </p>

                <h3>7. Notices</h3>

                    regarding this agreement or any aspect of the Platform, by
                    email to the email address that we have on record, by
                    regular mail or by posting it online. The date of receipt
                    shall be deemed the date on which such notice is given.
                </p>

                <h3>8. Important legal notes</h3>
                <p>
                    This Agreement and our relationship with you shall both be
                    interpreted solely in accordance with the laws of the State
                    of Uttar Pradesh, India excluding any rules governing choice
                    of laws. You irrevocably agree that the exclusive venue for
                    any action or proceeding arising out of relating to this
                    Agreement or our relationship with you, regardless of
                    theory, shall be the Lucknow High Court You irrevocably
                    consent to the personal jurisdiction of the aforementioned
                    court and hereby waive any objection to the exercise of
                    jurisdiction by the aforementioned court. This Agreement
                    constitutes the entire agreement between you and us. You
                    confirm that you have not relied upon any promises or
                    representations by us except as set forth in this Agreement.
                    We may change this Agreement by posting modifications on the
                    Platform. Unless otherwise specified by us, all
                    modifications shall be effective upon posting. Therefore,
                    you are encouraged to check the terms of this Agreement
                    frequently. The last update date of this Agreement is posted
                    at the bottom of the Agreement. By using the Platform after
                    the changes become effective, you agree to be bound by such
                    changes to the Agreement. If you do not agree to the
                    changes, you must terminate access to the Platform and
                    participation in its services. We may freely transfer or
                    assign this Agreement or any of its obligations hereunder.
                    The paragraph headings in this Agreement are solely for the
                    sake of convenience and will not be applied in the
                    interpretation of this Agreement. If any provision of this
                    Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
                    illegal, invalid, unenforceable, or otherwise contrary to
                    law, the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain
                    in full force and effect. To clear any doubt, all clauses
                    regarding limitations of liabilities and indemnification
                    shall survive the termination or expiration of this
                    Agreement.
